### Hey I'm John Okely 👋
I'm Head of Engineering at [Functionly](https://functionly.com/). I build and grow engineering cultures.

🙌 I get energy from building new skills in my team and forging products in new & better ways. 

🔧 Getting people & process right is the most important thing, but I still jump on the tools whenever I can.
